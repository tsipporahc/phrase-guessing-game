# Phrase Guessing Game
 Techdegree Unit 4 Project

**Purpose:** 
    This project was created to demonstrate foundational concepts in Javascript OOP and DOM manipulation. I created an a Phrase class to carry the phrases. I also created a Game class to carry the logic of the game. This is the final project for Unit 4 of the Treehouse Techdegree.

**Game Rules:** 
    1. Click "Start Game" button to display a gameboard with a random quote inspired by fruits.

    2. Click the on-screen keyboard to guess a letter in the phrase.

    3. If you you choose an incorrect letter, you will lose a heart/life. You have 5 chances to miss until you lose the game.
    
    4. After the game is over, click "Start Game" button to play a new game. 

**Challenges:**
    This project was challenging but rewarding. I learned about the importance of testing and creating and calling properties and methods in classes. The removeLife() method located in Game.js was the most challenging to create because I had to figure out how to get the Game.js file and the Phrase.js file to communicate to one another. 

**Future Considerations:**
    There are many things I would love to add on to this app. For example, I could add a timer or have users choose a difficulty level for the game.

**Project Styling Changes:**
    -Starting Page: changed the title of the game with subtitle, background color
    -Keyboard Buttons: increased border radius for static keyboard, decreased border radius for letter when wrong, decreased border radius for letter when wrong, changed button color upon selection, added shadowing and hover effects
    -Start Button: changed background color, added hover effects
    -Letter Placeholders: changed color, and added shadow effect
    -Game End Page: added number of loses to track user's loses
